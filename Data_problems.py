Initialize a stack, add 7 items to it then remove 3
everytime you remove, print the value you have just removed

#HINT the pop method returns the item it just removed

what makes a stack different from a regular list?
'''
# we can sace the value we just removed by writing:

#2

'''
Initialize a queue

add 4 items to it 
remove 3 items from it 


 What is the difference between a stack and a queue? what are the applications of a queue

Initialize/ create a set of 10 numbers

check if the number 5 is in the set, if it is print "5 is here"

What is a set? what makes a set special and different from other structures ?

'''
Initialize/ create 2 different tuples

combine the 2 tuples together to make one larger tuple

what is a tuple? what makes a tuple special/ different from other structures?

'''


#5 initialize and create 2 different dictionaries

'''
one dictionary should represent a humans physical features with the keys being

height, weight, age, eye color

and the other dictionary 

having names of items as keys and thier respective price as thier value pair


access 2 different values from each dicitonary and print them

What is a dictionary? what makes a dictionary different from the other data structures? what makes it usefull?

# what are the applications of a dicitonary?

#List Manipulation: Given a list mylist, write a Python program to remove all duplicate elements from the list while preserving the original order.

Tuple Operations: Create a tuple called student_data containing information about a student, such as name, age, and subjects. Use tuple indexing to access and print the student's age.

Set Operations: Create two sets, set1 and set2, each containing some elements. Write a Python program to find and print the intersection of these two sets (common elements in both sets).

Dictionary Manipulation: You have a dictionary student_grades that stores students' names as keys and their grades as values. Write a function that takes this dictionary as input and returns the name of the student with the highest grade.

Stack Implementation: Implement a stack class in Python that supports the push() and pop() operations. Test your stack class by pushing and popping elements to/from it.

Queue Implementation: Implement a queue class in Python that supports the enqueue() and dequeue() operations. Test your queue class by adding and removing elements from it.

List Sorting: Write a Python program to sort a list of tuples based on the second element of each tuple in ascending order.

List Comprehension: Create a list of all prime numbers less than 100 using list comprehension and a helper function that checks for prime numbers.

Dictionary Comprehension: Given a list of words, create a dictionary where the keys are words, and the values are the lengths of the words. Use dictionary comprehension to achieve this.
